- 👋 Hi, I’m @Xuppe
- 👀 I’m interested in creating applications that make life a bit easier. There's always something that could be done better!
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Computer Science so I'll be a little absent from the design community for the time being.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to embedded system programming!
- 📫 How to reach me... well, here! If I have any public repos that you're interested in, feel free to check them out and comment!

As always, big thanks for checking out my page! 😄
